### ✨ Feature Requests

Have an idea to improve JustMD? I'd love to hear it!

**What to include:**
- **Clear description** - What feature would you like to see?
- **Use case** - Why is this feature important? How would you use it?
- **Examples** - Reference other apps that do this well (if applicable)
- **Mockups/sketches** - Visual representation helps (optional but appreciated!)

**Example:**
```markdown
**Feature:** Add markdown syntax highlighting in the editor

**Use case:** As a user writing complex markdown documents, I would like to see
syntax highlighting for headers, bold, italic, and code blocks in the editor pane
to make it easier to spot formatting mistakes.

**Example:** VS Code's markdown preview does this well by highlighting different
syntax elements with subtle colors.
```

## ⏱️ Response Times

I maintain this project in my free time, so please be patient! Here's what you can expect:

| Issue Type | Typical Response Time |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Critical Bugs** (app broken, data loss) | 1-3 days |
| **Regular Bugs** | 3-7 days |
| **Feature Requests** | 1-2 weeks |
| **Questions/Discussions** | 3-7 days |

**Please note:**
- Response time ≠ resolution time. Complex issues may take longer to fix.
- I prioritize based on severity and impact on users.
- I'm located in **Brazil (UTC-3)**, so responses may come during Brazilian business hours.
- During holidays or busy periods, responses may be delayed.

## ✅ Issue Guidelines

To help me help you faster:

### DO ✅
- **Be respectful and patient** - Remember, this is a free, open-source project
- **Provide details** - More information = faster resolution
- **Use proper formatting** - Code blocks, headers, lists make issues easier to read
- **One issue per report** - Don't combine multiple bugs or requests
- **Update your issue** - If you find more info or a workaround, share it!
- **Close resolved issues** - If your problem is solved, close the issue

### DON'T ❌
- **Don't spam** - Bumping issues every day doesn't help
- **Don't be rude** - Constructive criticism is welcome, but be kind
- **Don't post duplicates** - Search first, then post
- **Don't share sensitive data** - Never post passwords, API keys, or personal information
- **Don't expect instant support** - I'm one person, not a 24/7 support team
